# RustEncryption
Public key encryption/decryption program in Rust

[Project is currently mostly incomplete]

This project is done for the Rust course at Portland State.

In this project, I will implement a public key encryption algorithm, which was initially provided by Dr. Sarah Mocas in her Cryptography course at Portland State.

The functionality that the final product will have will include the following:
  - Generate a private key consisting of 3 numbers
  - Generate a corresponding public key also consisting of 3 numbers
  - Given a key and a plaintext, encrypt it into ciphertext
  - Given the proper key and a ciphertext, decrypt it into plaintext
  
  When fully implemented, these actions will be done via command line.
